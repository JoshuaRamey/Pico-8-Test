# Pico-8 Test
This is just a small project to get a feel for working in Pico-8, a fantasy console for making, sharing and playing
tiny games and other computer programs using the Lua programming language. The goals of this project were to:

1) display a player object on the screen
2) allow movement of the player object
3) create sound on a button press
4) display the player object overtop of a map.

The player is represented by a blue ball.

### Controls
• Use the arrow keys to move

• Press the X key to play a small soundbyte.

My next project involving Pico-8 will be to make something with more depth, this project was just a test.
